JAN KEN PON ver 0.1

Controlls:
z - guu (Rock)
x - kii (Scisrs)
c - paa (Paper)

wasd - up/left/down/right

q - thumbs up

e - da bird

Rules of janken:
First is rock. Then you shoot. (on pon)
If you tie, you go again (on desho)
If someone wins the first round, you go to achimuite
Pick a direction. Whoever won the first part wins if the directions match.
Then you start over.

WARNING: Very buggy. Enemy AI is currently random, and doesn't pick right, 
and the timing might be off so that it seems like a tie/win when it shouldn't be.

I have this version with the debug menu enabled 
so you can see all the things that aren't working right.


Next step is general debugging, until everything works smoothly. Then comes juice.
Menus, sound, tighten up the graphics, actual enemy AI that reads your goddamn mind.
Also planning on adding more enemies, and having a campaign. Soon you'll be able to
increase the difficulty of the AI as well as the speed. Maybe I'll make it list street
fighter or punch-out and have you travel around the world fighting offensive stereotypes.
Maybe once the game works, I'll be able to add some online multiplayer. Who knows.
